									<span class="popLetter">J</span>ohn McArthur established the Law Office of John Burritt McArthur in
									2008 in order to combine his active trial docket with a growing practice as an arbitrator.
								</p>

								<p>
									<span class="popLetter">M</span>cArthur has been involved in some of the largest commercial disputes
									in his first 30 years of practice. In the 1980s, as a partner in Houston's Susman Godfrey LLP,
									McArthur played a major role in natural gas take-or-pay litigation. In addition, he handled major
									cases over a furniture distribution network, a defense of an insurance company for refusing to
									reimburse a novel cancer treatment, and defense of the seller of an offshore drilling rig. And he
									devoted substantial time to an antitrust lawsuit over tennis ball pricing and another antitrust case
									between Northrop Corporation and McDonnell-Douglas Aircraft over the F-18 fighter plane.
								</p>

								<p>
									<span class="popLetter">I</span>n the 1990s, McArthur represented one of Alaska's native corporations
									in a large dispute with the Department of the Interior, advised major oil companies on Alaskan
									matters, and handled other energy cases while in a mid-career program at Harvard's Kennedy School of
									Government and then a Ph.D. program in public policy at the University of California at Berkeley.
								</p>

								<p>
									<span class="popLetter">F</span>rom 1999 to 2008, while working for the law firm that ultimately
									became San Francisco's Hosie McArthur LLP, McArthur devoted the bulk of his time to a gasoline
									price-fixing case and to a series of oil posted-price and natural gas royalty cases, including cases
									for the States of Alaska and Louisiana. He provided trial representation for plaintiffs and defendants
									in high-dollar commercial cases, including for states and other clients in royalty and tax litigation.
									In addition, McArthur increasingly serves as an arbitrator in large commercial disputes. Even after
									2008, when he focused on serving as an arbitrator, he continued to handle the complex commercial cases
									listed under Litigation Experience.
								</p>

								<p>
									<span class="popLetter">M</span>cArthur was a trial lawyer in some of the largest trials during these
									years. Early in his career, he was one of the lawyers who tried the first take-or-pay case to go to
									trial on a repudiation theory. The jury awarded a $563 million verdict against El Paso Natural Gas
									Company in one of the top 10 jury verdicts in 1988. Soon after counsel, including McArthur, argued the
									appeal in a Houston court of appeals, El Paso settled by paying $302 in cash and returning mineral
									interests later appraised at $135 million.
								</p>

								<p>
									<span class="popLetter">M</span>cArthur played a major role in a 2004 case that Chevron filed against
									the State of Louisiana. The State's case began as a defense case. It was one of the few oil
									posted-price cases to go to trial. After the court realigned the State as the true plaintiff, the jury
									awarded $111 million against Chevron in one of the top 15 verdicts in 2004.
								</p>

								<p>
									<span class="popLetter">I</span>n 2012, McArthur served as lead trial counsel for the State of Alaska
									in successfully defending claims by an independent oil company that would have reallocated six million
									barrels of oil, with a market value of over $600 million dollars, from the State to various interest
									owners. For a representative list of other past cases, see <a href="experience.htm">Experience</a>.
								</p>

								<p>
									<span class="popLetter">M</span>cArthur represented clients in state and federal courts around the
									country, and represented plaintiffs and defendants. His clients ranged from some of the country's
									largest corporations to small businesses, Alaskan native corporations, States, and individuals,. Among
									his plaintiff clients were the states of Hawaii, Alaska, Louisiana, and Mississippi; Aetna Life
									Insurance; the second largest producer of natural gas in Texas; and one of the largest interstate gas
									marketers into the California market. Among his defense clients have been Aetna, Sonat Offshore,
									British Petroleum, BHP Proprietary (U.S.), and BASF.
								</p>

								<p>
									<span class="popLetter">I</span>n terms of subject matter, McArthur's cases ran the gamut of complex
									commercial cases and involved everything from antitrust and securities disputes to insurance and
									intellectual property lawsuits, from racketeering and qui tam claims to contract, fiduciary,
									partnership, joint venture, fraud and other tort disputes. His experience covers many varieties of
									energy cases.
								</p>

								<p>
									<span class="popLetter">M</span>cArthur has significant academic training, including in the economic
									concepts surrounding market definition and market power and the measurement of damages. Holding
									advanced degrees in economics and public administration as well as his law degree, and a Ph.D.
									in public policy, McArthur has graduate-level training in the economic and financial concepts used in
									many complex commercial disputes.
								</p>

								<p>
									<span class="popLetter">M</span>cArthur has a broader perspective on complex trial work than many
									lawyers because he has served as an expert and as an arbitrator as well as a trial lawyer. Among his
									expert testimony is the testimony cited with approval by the Arkansas Supreme Court in Seeco v. Hales,
									22 S.W.3d 157 (Ark. 2003).
								</p>

								<p>
									<span class="popLetter">H</span>e has written many articles in law reviews and bar publications,
									including articles on arbitration, judicial management, energy issues, and antitrust. For his recent
									publications, see <a href="publications.htm">Publications</a>.
								</p>

								<p>
									<span class="popLetter">M</span>cArthur first served as an arbitrator in 1994 and developed a
									full-time arbitration practice since he opened his office in 2008. McArthur is listed as a neutral for
									the Large Complex Case, Commercial Case, Oil and Gas, and National Energy Panels of the American
									Arbitration Association; as a Distinguished Neutral for the California and Energy, Oil and Gas Panels
									of the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution (CPR); as a Public Arbitrator
									for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and by the international arbitration centers
									of Hong Kong, Dubai, and Kuala Lumpur. He is a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators in
									London, the College of Commercial Arbitrators, the National Academy of Distinguished Neutrals, and a
									listed arbitrator for the London Court of International Arbitration. He is also a Sponsoring Member of
									the Institute for Transnational Arbitration. His approach to arbitration is summarized in <a
										href="arbitration.htm">Arbitration</a>.
								</p>

								<p>
									<span class="popLetter">M</span>cArthur has been acknowledged for his experience by his peers. He has
									held an "av" rating from Martindale-Hubbell for decades. In 2007, he was elected a Fellow of the
									Litigation Counsel of America, a fellowship composed of top American lawyers. He was a Co-Founder of
									the LCA's International Institute on Environment, Energy, and Natural Resources (IINREEL). He is a
									member of the Million Dollar Advocates Forum and the Multi-Million Dollar Advocates Forum.
